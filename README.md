# ImplicitIntentExample

This assignment is developed to implement Implicit Intent in an android application. Implicit intent does not explicitly 
specify the name of the target component but the action to be performed. Based on the action specified, the apps that can 
perform the action are listed to the user.

This app includes two functionalities: To launch a website and to ring a number.
